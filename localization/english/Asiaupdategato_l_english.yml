 je_investigacion_peruana: "Reform Imperial Examination"
 je_investigacion_peruana_reason: "For generations, sons of farmers, craftsmen and merchants broke down against the wall of the classics, only to be told they were unworthy. To be up to western education, we must slay the eight legged beast and finally open the gates of knowledge to all who possess talent. A nation of millions must draw the minds of millions.

 five_year_plan.1.d: "The Yellow River basin, once known for floods and famine, now hums with the power of furnaces and drills. The Five Year Plan set forth by the Emperor has reached its end — and with it, a new foundation has been forged in steel and coal. What began as a vision has taken physical form: mines stretch for miles, railroads connect the heartland, and thousands now labor in workshops that roar like dragons. The Empire has harnessed the river — not with dams, but with industry. This is no longer a dream. This is the future"
 five_year_plan.1.a: "We begin forging China's future."
 five_year_plan.1.f: "The furnaces are lit, the rails laid, the mines carved deep into the Yellow River's soil. What was once vision has become iron reality. Under the guiding hand of the Emperor, the Yellow River has become the beating heart of China's industrial ascent. Coal, iron, and ambition now flow stronger than the river itself."
 five_year_plan.2.t: "Five Year Plan: Blue River Industrial Complex"
 five_year_plan.2.d: "Following the triumph in the Yellow River basin, the second Five Year Plan concludes with resounding success. The Yangtze — cradle of southern civilization — now flows beside mills, engines, and steelworks. Through this transformation, the Celestial Empire narrows the gap with the West. Ancient towns are reborn as industrial strongholds, their walls echoing not with poetry, but with the rhythm of machines. The Dragon does not sleep — it prepares."
 five_year_plan.2.a: "The Dragon awakens."
 five_year_plan.2.f: "From Hangzhou to Chongqing, furnaces now glow where silence once reigned. Cities have risen, factories hum, and the Emperor’s will has reshaped the South. The Yangtze no longer nourishes alone — it now powers our rise to meet the world."
 je_five_year_plan_1_reason: "The Emperor has ordered the first Five Year Plan: the complete industrial transformation of the Yellow River basin. Coal, iron, and sulfur lie beneath its soil — and with them, the foundation of a new Chinese industry. This plan shall forge the Celestial Empire’s strength beneath the earth, giving it the tools to rise against Western superiority. Let the Dragon begin with iron."
 je_five_year_plan_2_reason: "With raw materials flowing from the Yellow River, the second Five Year Plan seeks to bring industry to the Yangtze. Textile mills, arms factories, and machine works will rise in the South. No longer shall the West lead in manufacturing. The Celestial Empire will match them — and in time, surpass them. Let the Dragon speak through steam."

 je_eic_india_reason: "For centuries our land has been torn apart by kingdoms, foreign companies and imperial ambitions. India, cradle of ancient civilizations, was divided by outsiders, its people reduced to subjects in their own home. But the tides of history are turning. Now winds of unity sweep across the land. From the Ganges to the Indus, from the Himalayas to Cape Comorin, one spirit awakens: the desire for freedom, greatness and dignity. To form India is not merely to draw borders, it is to restore the soul of a people who never stopped dreaming of their destiny. A single nation under one banner, with one purpose and one will. India shall no longer be a prize for conquerors, it shall be an empire remembered through the ages."
