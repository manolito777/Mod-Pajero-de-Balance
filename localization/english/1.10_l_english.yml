je_modernizationrus_reason: "In the boundless dominions of the Russian Empire, the prosperity and stability of the realm depend upon the enlightenment and discipline of its subjects. As the modern age dawns upon Europe, His Imperial Majesty recognizes that knowledge must stand as a pillar of national strength, guiding both the noble and the humble toward duty, faith, and service to the Motherland.

The Compulsory Education Program is established under the authority of the Crown to ensure that every child of the Empire, regardless of station, receives the means to read, write, and comprehend the sacred principles of loyalty and morality. Through education, the people shall become not only more productive and obedient citizens but also more faithful instruments of divine and imperial will.

Thus, the Tsar’s government decrees that ignorance shall no longer be a mark of the Russian peasant, but that every heart in the Empire shall be illuminated by learning, for the glory of Russia and the everlasting strength of the throne."
