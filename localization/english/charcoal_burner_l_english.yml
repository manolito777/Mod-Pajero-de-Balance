je_valfardsstaten: "valfardsstaten"
je_valfardsstaten_reason: "The foundation of the Välfärdsstaten is a thriving urban economy. We must modernize the infrastructure of our historic regions to generate the wealth necessary to support a national social safety net."
valfardsstaten_event.t: "The Promise of the Folkhemmet"
valfardsstaten_event.d: "The urbanization of our heartlands is complete. From the iron mines of Norrland to the ports of Scania, the engines of industry now hum in unison. With this economic might, we have finally secured the means to protect our citizenry from the ravages of poverty. The vision of Sweden as a 'People's Home'—a sanctuary of equality and mutual support—is finally within our grasp."

je_folkskola: "Folkskola"
je_folkskola_reason: "To compete with the great powers of Europe, Sweden requires a literate and skilled workforce. We must establish a system of universal primary education—the Folkskola—to enlighten the peasantry and prepare our nation for the challenges of industrialization."
folkskola_event.t: "The Folkskola Reform"
folkskola_event.d: "The implementation of the Folkskola system has been a resounding success.

je_reform_riksdag: "Reform of the Riksdag"
je_reform_riksdag_reason: "The ancient Riksdag of the Estates is a relic of the past that hinders effective governance.

reform_riksdag_event.t: "The Representation Reform Act"
reform_riksdag_event.d: "The proposal to abolish the four estates has finally passed. The old Riksdag of the Estates is no more.

The power of the nobility and clergy has been curtailed in favor of a system based on census suffrage."
reform_riksdag_event.f: "\"Old traditions must yield to new necessities. The voice of the nation can no longer be silenced by ancient privileges.\""
reform_riksdag_event.1.a: "A modern parliament for a modern nation."

je_Allmanna_Pensionsforsakringen: "Allmänna pensionsförsäkringen"
je_Allmanna_Pensionsforsakringen_reason: "The industrial age creates wealth, but often leaves the elderly destitute after a lifetime of labor.

By leveraging the immense profits from our northern iron mines, we can guarantee a dignified retirement for every citizen, regardless of their class."
Allmanna_Pensionsforsakringen_event.t: "Allmänna pensionsförsäkringen"
Allmanna_Pensionsforsakringen_event.d: "With the immense wealth generated by our northern iron mines and a steadfast commitment to human rights, we have successfully implemented the General Pension Insurance.

je_forest_dainam:0 "Exploitation of the Dai Nam Forests"
je_forest_dainam_reason:0 "The dense and ancient jungles of our highlands have long been an obstacle to travel. However, for an industrializing nation, they represent a priceless resource. We must organize the logging of these forests to fuel our construction sectors and shipyards."
forest_dainam.t:0 "The Conquered Wilderness"

Through the relentless effort of our loggers, the ancient forests have been cleared, leaving behind vast stockpiles of timber and open land ready for development.
