 je_investigacion_peruana: "Reform Imperial Examination"
 je_investigacion_peruana_reason: "For generations, sons of farmers, craftsmen and merchants broke down against the wall of the classics, only to be told they were unworthy. To be up to western education, we must slay the eight legged beast and finally open the gates of knowledge to all who possess talent. A nation of millions must draw the minds of millions.

 five_year_plan.1.d: "The Yellow River basin, once known for floods and famine, now hums with the power of furnaces and drills. The Five Year Plan set forth by the Emperor has reached its end — and with it, a new foundation has been forged in steel and coal. What began as a vision has taken physical form: mines stretch for miles, railroads connect the heartland, and thousands now labor in workshops that roar like dragons. The Empire has harnessed the river — not with dams, but with industry. This is no longer a dream. This is the future"
 five_year_plan.1.a: "We begin forging China's future."
 five_year_plan.1.f: "The furnaces are lit, the rails laid, the mines carved deep into the Yellow River's soil. What was once vision has become iron reality. Under the guiding hand of the Emperor, the Yellow River has become the beating heart of China's industrial ascent. Coal, iron, and ambition now flow stronger than the river itself."
 five_year_plan.2.t: "Five Year Plan: Blue River Industrial Complex"
 five_year_plan.2.d: "Following the triumph in the Yellow River basin, the second Five Year Plan concludes with resounding success. The Yangtze — cradle of southern civilization — now flows beside mills, engines, and steelworks. Through this transformation, the Celestial Empire narrows the gap with the West. Ancient towns are reborn as industrial strongholds, their walls echoing not with poetry, but with the rhythm of machines. The Dragon does not sleep — it prepares."
 five_year_plan.2.a: "The Dragon awakens."
 five_year_plan.2.f: "From Hangzhou to Chongqing, furnaces now glow where silence once reigned. Cities have risen, factories hum, and the Emperor’s will has reshaped the South. The Yangtze no longer nourishes alone — it now powers our rise to meet the world."
 je_five_year_plan_1_reason: "The Emperor has ordered the first Five Year Plan: the complete industrial transformation of the Yellow River basin. Coal, iron, and sulfur lie beneath its soil — and with them, the foundation of a new Chinese industry. This plan shall forge the Celestial Empire’s strength beneath the earth, giving it the tools to rise against Western superiority. Let the Dragon begin with iron."
 je_five_year_plan_2_reason: "With raw materials flowing from the Yellow River, the second Five Year Plan seeks to bring industry to the Yangtze. Textile mills, arms factories, and machine works will rise in the South. No longer shall the West lead in manufacturing. The Celestial Empire will match them — and in time, surpass them. Let the Dragon speak through steam."

 law_artisan_system: "Artisan System"
 law_artisan_system_desc: "Artisanal production was organized in small workshops run by a master craftsman, who controlled every stage of the work. Under him were journeymen (skilled workers) and apprentices, who often lived with the master or spent most of their time in the workshop. Production was manual, highly skilled, and personalized, with no strict separation between design and execution. This created a close, almost domestic labor relationship and a local economy shaped by informal guild-like structures."

They demand constitutional rule, modernization, and a break with the past they deem rotten and obsolete. Yet not all celebrate this victory. In the shadows, disgruntled officers, clerics, and forgotten elites whisper of another path one that rejects both reform and decay. They speak of restoring an older, purer order, long buried beneath centuries of conquest, waiting only for unrest to bring it back to life. The Empire stands at a crossroads.

Order must be imposed, resistance broken, and the empire reforged through decisive action. When the purification bar is filled, there will be no return the old imperial balance will shatter, and a new, uncompromising order will rise from its ashes.

Now, with the Roman state reborn and Russia standing as the other great Orthodox power, the time has come to act together. By aligning our cause with Russia, we pledge to defend the Orthodox faith wherever it is threatened, presenting ourselves not merely as a state, but as the shield of true Christianity against heresy and oppression"
 je_defender_faith: "The Healing of the Schism"
 je_defender_faith_reason: "The Great Schism shattered Christendom and left the Orthodox world divided from its ancient heart. Rome must be reclaimed, not as a rival throne, but as a restored pillar of the true faith. Yet unity cannot come at the cost of sacrifice. The sacred cities of Constantinople, Antioch, and Jerusalem are the living foundations of Orthodoxy and must remain firmly under Orthodox protection. Only by restoring Rome while safeguarding the holy sites can the schism be healed and the Orthodox world reunited without betrayal"
 je_defender_faith2: "Defenders of the Holy Sees"
 je_defender_faith2_reason: "The unity of Orthodoxy rests upon the protection of its sacred cities. Rome, Constantinople, Antioch, and Jerusalem are more than symbols; they are the foundations of the true faith. To preserve the restored unity of Christendom, these holy sees must be defended against heresy, foreign domination, and internal subversion. Only by safeguarding them all can the Orthodox world endure and remain whole."

By securing them under firm control, the empire stabilizes its borders and protects the heartlands from external threats"
 ensure_piracy_je: "Guardians of the Central Mediterranean"
 ensure_piracy_je_reason: "Libya and Tunisia stand as the empire’s western shield in the Mediterranean. Their coasts have long been used to suppress piracy, project power, and protect maritime trade. By securing these provinces, the empire asserts control over the central sea lanes and prevents hostile powers from exploiting instability along the North African shore"
 ensure_egypt_je: "Mastery of the Nile"
 ensure_egypt_je_reason: "Egypt is the economic lifeline of the empire. Its agricultural wealth, strategic position, and control over key trade routes make it indispensable. Securing Egypt ensures uninterrupted commerce, strengthens imperial finances, and prevents rival powers from undermining Ottoman authority in the eastern Mediterranean"
 mantain_greece_je: "Holding the Aegean Sea"
 mantain_greece_je_reason: "Securing Greece was only the first step. To maintain Ottoman dominance in the Aegean, the region must remain stable, loyal, and firmly integrated into the imperial system. Naval presence, administration, and internal order are essential to prevent foreign interference and renewed unrest"
 mantain_egypt_je: "Administering Egypt"
 mantain_egypt_je_reason: "Control of Egypt brings immense wealth, but also responsibility. The province must be governed efficiently to secure trade, taxation, and agricultural output. Any lapse in authority risks economic disruption and foreign intrigue along the Nile"
 mantain_balkans_je: "Stability in the Balkan Frontier"
 mantain_balkans_je_reason: "The Balkan territories are secured, but their loyalty cannot be taken for granted. Continuous military readiness, administrative oversight, and political control are required to keep the northern frontier intact and prevent the empire’s defenses from collapsing"
 mantain_piracy_je: "Order in the Central Mediterranean"
 mantain_piracy_je_reason: "With Libya and Tunisia secured, the empire must now ensure lasting order along the North African coast. Piracy must remain suppressed, ports maintained, and imperial authority enforced. Only constant vigilance will keep the central Mediterranean under Ottoman control"

Among the proposed solutions is an ambitious iron bridge design, championed by the engineer Stanisław Kierbedź, whose experience in large-scale infrastructure projects has earned him recognition within imperial technical circles.

Designed and overseen by the engineer Stanisław Kierbedź, the iron structure stands as a triumph of modern engineering and state coordination. Merchants, officials, and laborers alike now cross the river with unprecedented ease, reshaping the economic and administrative life of Warsaw. Beyond its practical benefits, the bridge serves as a visible symbol of industrial progress and imperial authority in Congress Poland."

While the iron span has greatly improved trade and administration, it also offers a ready crossing for any advancing army. Military planners argue that destroying the bridge would slow enemy movements and buy valuable time, though at the cost of undoing years of investment and disrupting civilian life. Others warn that its loss would deal a heavy blow to morale and economic stability in Warsaw. The decision must be made swiftly, before events overtake deliberation."

Where the Kierbedź Bridge once stood, only twisted remnants and temporary crossings remain — a silent reminder of the price paid to delay the enemy. Now, with peace restored and resources once again directed toward development, calls have grown to rebuild the bridge. Engineers argue that modern methods can produce a structure stronger than before, while civic leaders see reconstruction as an act of renewal and confidence. To rebuild the bridge is to acknowledge both what was lost and what must endure: the conviction that progress, though interrupted, cannot be permanently denied."
